#' Converts date from week notation according to ISO 8601 to standard notation
#'
#' Returns the date of a given weekdate (year, week of the year, day of week according 
#' to ISO 8601). It is the inverse function to \code{\link{date2ISOweek}} and a substitute for 
#' \code{strptime(x, "\%G-W\%V-\%u")}.
#'
#' \code{strptime} accepts but ignores the conversion specifications 
#' \code{\%g}, \code{\%G}, \code{\%V} on input.
#' According to ISO 8601, the year of the week can differ from the calendar year (see the examples).
#'
#' @param weekdate A character vector of year, week, and weekday in format "\code{\%G-W\%V-\%u}"
#' @return A vector of class \code{Date}
#' @seealso The inverse function \code{\link{date2ISOweek}}. \code{\link{strptime}} for a 
#' description of conversion specifications and references on ISO 8601.
