#' Week of the year according to ISO 8601
#'
#' This function returns the year and the week of the year of a given date according to ISO 8601.
#' It is an substitute for the \code{\%Y-W\%V} format which is not implemented on Windows.
#'
#' According to ISO 8601, the year of the week can differ from the calendar year (see the examples).
#'
#' @param date Vector which can be coerced to class \code{Date}
#' @return A character vector of year and week in format "\code{\%Y-W\%V}"
#' @seealso \code{\link{strptime}} for a description of the date formats and references on ISO 8601. 
#'   \code{isoWeekYear} in the \code{surveillance} package for an alternative implementation.
