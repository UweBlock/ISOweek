Package ISOweek computes week of the year and weekday according to ISO 8601.

This is an alternative to strftime(x, "%G-W%V") and a substitute for strptime(x, "%G-W%V-%u") on input. In addition, the package offers functions to convert from standard calender format yyyy-mm-dd to and from ISO 8601 week format yyyy-Www-d.
