#' Converts date from week notation according to ISO 8601 to standard notation
#'
#' This function returns the date of a given weekdate (year, week of the year, day of week according to ISO 8601).
#' It is the inverse function to \code{date2ISOweek}.
#'
#' According to ISO 8601, the year of the week can differ from the calendar year (see the examples).
#'
#' @param weekdate A character vector of year, week, and weekday in format "\code{\%Y-W\%V-\%u}"
#' @return A vector of class \code{Date}
#' @seealso \code{\link{strptime}} for a description of the date formats and references on ISO 8601.
